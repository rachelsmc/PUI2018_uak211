I completed assignments 1 and 2 on my own, referencing this stackoverflow 
[answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11963711/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-search-nested-lists-in-python#11963810)
to figure out how to calculate the distribution of all sample means from a nested list and this [answer]
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46889189/plot-a-density-function-above-a-histogram) to plot a KDE over a histogram.

For assignment 1, I wanted to write a function for standardizing the plots of the different distributions so the distributions rather than
different plot aesthetics would show through. I am well acquainted with the law of large numbers and central limit theorem and developed 
an interactive [Shiny app](https://ukacz.shinyapps.io/asymptotics) illustrating them with coin toss results.

For assignment 2, I chose to compare citibike use in two different seasons because I had thought about the influence of temperature on citibike
use before.
