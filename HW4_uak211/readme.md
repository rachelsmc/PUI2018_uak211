I completed assignments 1, 2, and 3 on my own, referencing this stackoverflow 
[answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11963711/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-search-nested-lists-in-python#11963810)
to figure out how to calculate the distribution of all sample means from a nested list and this 
[answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46889189/plot-a-density-function-above-a-histogram) to plot a KDE over a histogram.

For assignment 1, I wanted to write a function for standardizing the plots of the different distributions so the distributions rather than
different plot aesthetics would show through. I am well acquainted with the law of large numbers and central limit theorem and developed 
an interactive [Shiny app](https://ukacz.shinyapps.io/asymptotics) illustrating them with coin toss results. I have also developed an [app](https://ukacz.shinyapps.io/distributions) showing how distributions look as their parameters change and as sample sizes increase.

For assignment 2, I chose to compare citibike use in two different seasons because I had thought about the influence of temperature on citibike use before. 
I modified the sample get data function Dr. Bianco wrote to account for the different file naming convention in the data index. 
I have struggled to render LaTeX in the notebooks so that they show up properly on github.

For assignment 3, I did not rely on any library z-score function, just wrote an equation using the parameters of the regular and alternative times distributions.s
